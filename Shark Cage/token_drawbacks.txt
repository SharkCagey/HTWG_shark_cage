Drawback 1:
also the service needs to run under different, not SYSTEM account
reason: Cygwin states:
the permission "Create a token object" gets explicitly removed from the SYSTEM user's access token,
when starting services under that account. 
That requires us to create a new account with this specific permission just to run this kind of services.
